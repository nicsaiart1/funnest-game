# Build Documentation

This document contains detailed instructions for building and developing the Fast Tap Challenge game project.

## Development Environment Setup

### Required Tools

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- A text editor or IDE (Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Optional: Local development server (Python's http.server, Live Server VS Code extension, etc.)

### Environment Configuration

No special environment configuration is needed as this is a pure HTML5/CSS/JavaScript application.

## Building from Source

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nicsaiart1/funnest-game.git
cd funnest-game
```

### Step 2: Running the Game

No build process is required. You can open the index.html file directly in your browser:

```bash
# Option 1: Open directly
open index.html  # macOS
start index.html  # Windows
xdg-open index.html  # Linux

# Option 2: Use a local server (recommended for development)
# Using Python 3:
python -m http.server 8000

# Using Node.js and npm:
npx serve
```

When using a local server, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Edit the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files in your editor
2. Refresh the browser to see your changes
3. Use browser developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) to debug issues

### Code Structure

- `index.html` - Main HTML structure and game UI elements
- `styles.css` - Styling and responsive design for the game
- `game.js` - Core game logic and canvas rendering

## Performance Optimization

### Tips for Optimal Performance

1. Keep the canvas size reasonable for the device
2. Minimize DOM manipulations during gameplay
3. Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
4. Clear parts of the canvas that change rather than the entire canvas when possible
5. Test on various devices to ensure smooth performance

## Mobile Testing

### Touch Event Handling

The game uses both mouse and touch events for cross-device compatibility. When testing:

1. Ensure touch events are working properly on mobile devices
2. Test pinch-to-zoom is disabled correctly
3. Validate that UI elements are appropriately sized for touch targets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Game Runs Slowly on Mobile

**Solution:** Check if the canvas size is appropriate for the device. Reduce the number of simultaneous targets or effects.

#### Touch Events Not Working

**Solution:** Ensure event.preventDefault() is being called in your touch event handlers and that the passive option is set to false where needed.
